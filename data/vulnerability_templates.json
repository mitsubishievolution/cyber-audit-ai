  "_description": "Vulnerability plain-English templates for the cybersecurity audit tool. Each category maps to a simple explanation that a non-technical business owner can understand. Templates are written at a Grade 6 reading level.",

  "categories": {

    "SQL_INJECTION": {
      "title": "Your Website Can Be Tricked Into Revealing Private Data",
      "what_this_means": "A part of your website accepts input from users, like a search box or login form. This input is not being checked properly. An attacker can type in special commands instead of normal text. Your website then runs those commands without realising they are harmful.",
      "why_it_matters": "An attacker could use this to read, change, or delete information stored in your database. This includes customer records, passwords, orders, and any other data your business holds."
    },

    "XSS": {
      "title": "Your Website Can Be Used to Attack Your Visitors",
      "what_this_means": "Your website allows harmful code to be added to its pages. When another user visits that page, the harmful code runs in their browser without them knowing. This is called Cross-Site Scripting.",
      "why_it_matters": "Attackers can use this to steal login sessions, redirect users to fake websites, or collect personal information from people who visit your site. Your visitors could be harmed just by using your website."
    },

    "OPEN_PORT_SSH": {
      "title": "A Remote Access Door Is Open on Your Server",
      "what_this_means": "Your server has a port open that allows people to connect to it remotely using a tool called SSH. This is sometimes needed for management, but if it is not secured properly it is a risk.",
      "why_it_matters": "If an attacker guesses or steals the right password, they can log in to your server directly. From there they could view your files, change settings, or take control of your system."
    },

    "OPEN_PORT_HTTP": {
      "title": "Your Website Is Accessible Over an Unencrypted Connection",
      "what_this_means": "Your server is accepting connections on port 80, which is standard web traffic. However, this connection is not encrypted. Any data sent between a visitor and your site can be read by others on the same network.",
      "why_it_matters": "If customers enter any information on your site, such as a name, email, or payment details, that information could be intercepted and read by a third party."
    },

    "OPEN_PORT_HTTPS": {
      "title": "Your Website Has a Secure Connection Available",
      "what_this_means": "Your server has port 443 open, which means it supports encrypted HTTPS connections. This is the standard secure way for websites to communicate with visitors.",
      "why_it_matters": "While having HTTPS available is good, you should make sure all traffic is forced to use it. If users can still access your site without HTTPS, their data could still be at risk."
    },

    "OPEN_PORT_FTP": {
      "title": "An Old File Transfer System Is Exposed",
      "what_this_means": "Your server has FTP open, which is a system used to upload and download files. FTP is an old protocol that sends usernames and passwords as plain text with no encryption.",
      "why_it_matters": "Anyone monitoring the network can see your FTP login details as they are sent. This could give an attacker full access to your file storage. Most modern systems replace FTP with a more secure alternative."
    },

    "OPEN_PORT_GENERIC": {
      "title": "An Unexpected Network Port Is Open",
      "what_this_means": "A port on your server is open and accessible from the internet. Each open port is a potential entry point. If this port does not need to be open, it should be closed.",
      "why_it_matters": "Every open port that is not needed increases the number of ways an attacker could try to get into your system. Keeping only the necessary ports open reduces your risk."
    },

    "OUTDATED_SOFTWARE": {
      "title": "Your Software Has a Known Security Problem",
      "what_this_means": "One of the software packages running on your server is out of date. The version in use has known security issues that have already been found and made public. Newer versions with fixes exist.",
      "why_it_matters": "Attackers actively search for systems running old software because the weaknesses are already known and documented. Your system could be targeted specifically because of this."
    },

    "WEAK_SSL": {
      "title": "Your Website Encryption Is Weak or Broken",
      "what_this_means": "Your website uses encryption to protect data sent between your server and visitors. However, the encryption being used is an older version that is no longer considered safe.",
      "why_it_matters": "Weak encryption can be broken by attackers. This means private data sent to and from your website, including any form submissions or login details, may be readable by a third party."
    },

    "DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS": {
      "title": "Your System Is Using Default Login Details",
      "what_this_means": "A part of your system is still using the username and password that came with it by default. These default details are publicly available and are the first thing attackers try.",
      "why_it_matters": "An attacker does not need to guess your password if it has never been changed from the default. This is one of the easiest ways for someone to gain access to your system."
    },

    "INFO_DISCLOSURE": {
      "title": "Your System Is Sharing Information It Should Keep Private",
      "what_this_means": "Your server or website is sending back technical details in its responses that it should not be sharing. This might include software names, version numbers, or server configuration details.",
      "why_it_matters": "While this information alone may not cause harm, it gives attackers useful details to plan a more targeted attack. It is like leaving a map of your building on the front door."
    },

    "MISSING_HEADERS": {
      "title": "Your Website Is Missing Important Security Settings",
      "what_this_means": "Web browsers follow instructions sent by your server about how to handle your website safely. Some of these security instructions are missing from your server responses.",
      "why_it_matters": "Without these instructions, browsers do not know to apply extra protections. This makes it easier for attackers to carry out certain types of attacks against people visiting your site."
    },

    "GENERIC": {
      "title": "A Security Issue Was Found on Your System",
      "what_this_means": "A vulnerability was detected on your system during the security scan. This means there is a weakness that could potentially be used by an attacker to cause harm.",
      "why_it_matters": "Any unaddressed vulnerability is a risk to your business and your customers. Even issues that seem minor can be combined with other weaknesses to cause serious damage."
    }
  },

  "severity_context": {
    "CRITICAL": "This issue is extremely serious and needs to be dealt with immediately. An attacker could cause major damage to your business if this is not fixed.",
    "HIGH": "This is a serious issue that should be addressed as soon as possible. It poses a real and significant risk to your business.",
    "MEDIUM": "This issue is a concern and should be reviewed and fixed within a reasonable timeframe. Left unresolved, it could become a larger problem.",
    "LOW": "This is a lower-level issue that should still be noted and fixed, but it poses less immediate risk than higher severity findings.",
    "UNKNOWN": "The severity of this issue could not be determined. It should still be reviewed to understand the potential impact."
  }
